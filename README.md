# Novika

Novika is an interpreted programming language, somewhat related to
Forth, Red/Rebol, Self, and Lisp.

This repo is the most recent (9th) reference implementation of Novika.

This implementation is slow (very slow) and buggy. Currently, it can't
even be used for experimentation, let alone production. Mainly due to
core components being relatively undeveloped.

The repository is unorganized. Code is raw. Beware.

For an example of Novika code, see `basis.nk`.

## Language notes

- Novika has *words* and *blocks*. Together they are known as *forms*.
Forms are *enclosed* in blocks by being surrounded with `[]`s:

  ```novika
  [ 1 2 + ]
  ```

- Words are immutable. Block is the only mutable kind of form.

- Words are separated by whitespaces. Word is an umbrella for:
  - Word: `foo bar +baz 2dup a.Ny.Comb-ina+t\iOn`
  - Quoted word: `#foo`
  - Number: `123`
  - Quote: `'hello world'`

- Comments = double quotes: `1 "I'm a comment" 2 +`

- Blocks consist of a *tape* and a *table*.
  - Block tape is an ordered list plus an insertion point called *cursor*.
  - Block table is an ordered hash map mapping form to form.

- `open` (opening) = evaluate (evaluating).

- Words have definitions. Definitions can be pushed onto the stack, or
  opened. Definitions are fetched from the block enclosing the word when
  that block is opened.

- If definition is not found in the enclosing block, the parent block
  (one that encloses the enclosing block) is checked, etc. When the
  parent block is reached and the definition is still not found, the
  `/default` word is opened in the original block, with quoted word
  on the stack.

- All forms except words are pushed onto the stack. Stack holds
  intermediate results. Stack is a block. With `there`, custom
  stack block may be specified.

    ```novika
    [ ] [ 1 2 + ] there "-- [ 3 ]"
    ```

- Blocks need to be opened explicitly unless they are under a word
  that does that:

    ```novika
    [ 1 2 + ] open "3"

    [ 1 2 + ] @: 1+2

    1+2 "3"
    ```

- Blocks are objects. Blocks are instantiated upon opening. `self`
  pushes the instance. `self prototype` pushes the prototype block,
  which is the block you with your eyes in this example:

  ```novika
  [ $: y  $: x
    self
  ] @: newPoint

  0 0 newPoint "[ | . x y ]"
    #x . "todo, and .x later"
    #y . "todo, and .y later"
  ```

Working with the insertion point:

```novika
  [ 1 2 3 ] "[ 1 2 3 | ]"
  [ 1 2 3 ] #<| there "[ 1 2 | 3 ]
  [ + ] there  "[ 3 | 3 ]"
  [ echo ] there "Prints 3 ;; [ | 3]"
  open "3"
```
